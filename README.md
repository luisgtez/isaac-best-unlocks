# Isaac Unlock Tracker

A simple app to visualize your Binding of Isaac: Repentance save progress and the best unlocks remaining.

It shows:
- Character unlocks and the items they unlock, ranked by quality
- Challenge unlocks and their unlocks, ranked by quality.

This helps you prioritize the best unlocks first.

## Features

- **Dashboard support**: Streamlit UI support to show the unlocks done and remaining and be able to sort the by quality.
- **CLI Support**: Simple console support to show the unlocks done and remaining.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Binding of Isaac: Repentance (with an existing save file)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/luisgtez/isaac-best-unlocks
   cd isaac-unlock-tracker
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Streamlit Usage
1. Run the `run-ui.bat` file. A browser window should open with the UI
2. Upload your game save file i.e.: `rep+persistentgamedata1.dat` the last number of the file name may change depending on the profile that you want to explore.
3. Now a table with your progress data should appear, you can sort by quality by clicking in the "Quality" column.

### CLI Usage
1. Run the `./src/cli-ui.py -f <SAVE_FILE_PATH>` file passing the path to your save file. This will show your progress in the console.

2. To sort by quality or completed look into the file code for some examples on how to sort.

## Future Improvements

- Improving visual interface with characters and items images.
- Adding more filters to visual interface (allow multiple column sorting)
   - Adding filters over which data to show based on if the challenge/character is unlocked or not
   - Adding filters to choose between searching only characters, challenges, normal characters or tainted characters
- Adding random picker based on what completitions are left
   - Adding optional weigthed random picker based on quality of completitions left
